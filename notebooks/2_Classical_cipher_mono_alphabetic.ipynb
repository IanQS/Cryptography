      "uch as five minutes and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control it was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen the smallest thing could give you away a nervous tic an unconscious look of anxiety a habit of muttering to yourselfanything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality of having something to hide in any case to wear an improper expression on your face to look incredulous when a victory was announced for example was itself a punishable offence there was even a word for it in newspeak facecrime it was called  the girl had turned her back on him again perhaps after all she was not really following him about perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so close to him two days running his cigarette had gone out and he laid it carefully on the edge of the table he would finish smoking it after work if he could keep the tobacco in it quite likely the person at the next table was a spy of the thought police and quite likely he would be in the cellars of the ministry of love within three days but a cigarette end must not be wasted syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it away in his pocket parsons had begun talking again  did i ever tell you old boy he said chuckling round the stem of his pipe about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old marketwomans skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster of bb sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches burned her quite badly i believe little beggars eh but keen as mustard thats a firstrate training they give them in the spies nowadaysbetter than in my day even what dyou thinks the latest thing theyve served them out with ear trumpets for listening through keyholes my little girl brought one home the other nighttried it out on our sittingroom door and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole of course its only a toy mind you still gives em the right idea eh  at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle it was the signal to return to work all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts and the remaining tobacco fell out of winstons cigarette     chapter     winston was writing in his diary      it was three years ago it was on a dark evening in a narrow sidestreet near one of the big railway stations she was standing near a doorway in the wall under a street lamp that hardly gave any light she had a young face painted very thick it was really the paint that appealed to me the whiteness of it like a mask and the bright red lips party women never paint their faces there was nobody else in the street and no telescreens she said two dollars i   for the moment it was too difficult to go on he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice or to bang his head against the wall to kick over the table and hurl the inkpot through the windowto do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him  your worst enemy he reflected was your own nervous system at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back a quite ordinarylooking man a party member aged thirtyfive to forty tallish and thin carrying a briefcase they were a few metres apart when the left side of the mans face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm it happened again just as they were passing one another it was only a twitch a quiver rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter but obviously habitual he remembered thinking at the time that poor devil is done for and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep there was no way of guarding against that so far as he could see  he drew his breath and went on writing      i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen there was a bed against the wall and a lamp on the table turned down very low she   his teeth were set on edge he would have liked to spit simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine his wife winston was marriedhad been married at any rate probably he still was married so far as he knew his wife was not dead he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent but nevertheless alluring because no woman of the party ever used scent or could be imagined as doing so only the proles used scent in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication  when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts consorting with prostitutes was forbidden of course but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break it was dangerous but it was not a lifeanddeath matter to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forcedlabour camp not more if you had committed no other offence and it was easy enough provided that you could avoid being caught in the act the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin which the proles were not supposed to drink tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed mere debauchery did not matter very much so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members butthough this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed toit was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening  the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control its real undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act not love so much as eroticism was the enemy inside marriage as well as outside it all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose andthough the principle was never clearly statedpermission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation like having an enema this again was never put into plain words but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards there were even organizations such as the junior antisex league which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination artsem it was called in newspeak and brought up in public institutions this winston was aware was not meant altogether seriously but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party the party was trying to kill the sex instinct or if it could not be killed then to distort it and dirty it he did not know why this was so but it seemed natural that it should be so and as far as the women were concerned the partys efforts were largely successful  he thought again of katharine it must be nine tennearly eleven years since they had parted it was curious how seldom he thought of her for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married they had only been together for about fifteen months the party did not permit divorce but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children  katharine was a tall fairhaired girl very straight with splendid movements she had a bold aquiline face a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it very early in her married life he had decidedthough perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most peoplethat she had without exception the most stupid vulgar empty mind that he had ever encountered she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan and there was no imbecility absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her the human soundtrack he nicknamed her in his own mind yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thingsex  as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression she would lie there with shut eyes neither resisting nor cooperating but submitting it was extraordinarily embarrassing and after a while horrible but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate but curiously enough it was katharine who refused this they must she said produce a child if they could so the performance continued to happen once a week quite regularly whenever it was not impossible she even used to remind him of it in the morning as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten she had two names for it one was making a baby and the other was our duty to the party yes she had actually used that phrase quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round but luckily no child appeared and in the end she agreed to give up trying and soon afterwards they parted  winston sighed inaudibly he picked up his pen again and wrote      she threw herself down on the bed and at once without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse horrible way you can imagine pulled up her skirt i   he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharines white body frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the party why did it always have to be like this why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event the women of the party were all alike chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty by careful early conditioning by games and cold water by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league by lectures parades songs slogans and martial music the natural feeling had been driven out of them his reason told him that there must be exceptions but his heart did not believe it they were all impregnable as the party intended that they should be and what he wanted more even than to be loved was to break down that wall of virtue even if it were only once in his whole life the sexual act successfully performed was rebellion desire was thoughtcrime even to have awakened katharine if he could have achieved it would have been like a seduction although she was his wife  but the rest of the story had got to be written down he wrote      i turned up the lamp when i saw her in the light   after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright for the first time he could see the woman properly he had taken a step towards her and then halted full of lust and terror he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do  it had got to be written down it had got to be confessed what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask there were streaks of white in her hair but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness she had no teeth at all  he wrote hurriedly in scrabbling handwriting      when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman fifty years old at least but i went ahead and did it just the same   he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again he had written it down at last but it made no difference the therapy had not worked the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever     chapter     if there is hope wrote winston it lies in the proles  if there was hope it must lie in the proles because only there in those swarming disregarded masses  per cent of the population of oceania could the force to destroy the party ever be generated the party could not be overthrown from within its enemies if it had any enemies had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another even if the legendary brotherhood existed as just possibly it might it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes rebellion meant a look in the eyes an inflexion of the voice at the most an occasional whispered word but the proles if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength would have no need to conspire they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it and yet  he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices womens voiceshad burst from a sidestreet a little way ahead it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair a deep loud ohooooh that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell his heart had leapt its started he had thought a riot the proles are breaking loose at last when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans they were wretched flimsy things but cookingpots of any kind were always difficult to get now the supply had unexpectedly given out the successful women bumped and jostled by the rest were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall accusing the stallkeeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve there was a fresh outburst of yells two bloated women one of them with her hair coming down had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one anothers hands for a moment they were both tugging and then the handle came off winston watched them disgustedly and yet just for a moment what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered  he wrote      until they become conscious they will never rebel and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious   that he reflected might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks the party claimed of course to have liberated the proles from bondage before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists they had been starved and flogged women had been forced to work in the coal mines women still did work in the coal mines as a matter of fact children had been sold into the factories at the age of six but simultaneously true to the principles of doublethink the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection like animals by the application of a few simple rules in reality very little was known about the proles it was not necessary to know much so long as they continued to work and breed their other activities were without importance left to themselves like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them a sort of ancestral pattern they were born they grew up in the gutters they went to work at twelve they passed through a brief blossomingperiod of beauty and sexual desire they married at twenty they were middleaged at thirty they died for the most part at sixty heavy physical work the care of home and children petty quarrels with neighbours films football beer and above all gambling filled up the horizon of their minds to keep them in control was not difficult a few agents of the thought police moved always among them spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer workinghours or shorter rations and even when they became discontented as they sometimes did their discontent led nowhere because being without general ideas they could only focus it on petty specific grievances the larger evils invariably escaped their notice the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes even the civil police interfered with them very little there was a vast amount of criminality in london a whole worldwithinaworld of thieves bandits prostitutes drugpeddlers and racketeers of every description but since it all happened among the proles themselves it was of no importance in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them promiscuity went unpunished divorce was permitted for that matter even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it they were beneath suspicion as the party slogan put it proles and animals are free  winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer it had begun itching again the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like he took out of the drawer a copy of a childrens history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs parsons and began copying a passage into the diary      in the old days it ran before the glorious revolution london was not the beautiful city that we know today it was a dark dirty miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them these rich men were called capitalists they were fat ugly men with wicked faces like the one in the picture on the opposite page you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat and a queer shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe which was called a top hat this was the uniform of the capitalists and no one else was allowed to wear it the capitalists owned everything in the world and everyone else was their slave they owned all the land all the houses all the factories and all the money if anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison or they could take his job away and starve him to death when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him and take off his cap and address him as sir the chief of all the capitalists was called the king and   but he knew the rest of the catalogue there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves the judges in their ermine robes the pillory the stocks the treadmill the catonine tails the lord mayors banquet and the practice of kissing the popes toe there was also something called the jus primae noctis which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories  how could you tell how much of it was lies it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity but simply its bareness its dinginess its listlessness life if you looked about you bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve great areas of it even for a party member were neutral and nonpolitical a matter of slogging through dreary jobs fighting for a place on the tube darning a wornout sock cadging a saccharine tablet saving a cigarette end the ideal set up by the party was something huge terrible and glitteringa world of steel and concrete of monstrous machines and terrifying weaponsa nation of warriors and fanatics marching forward in perfect unity all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans perpetually working fighting triumphing persecutingthree hundred million people all with the same face the reality was decaying dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes in patchedup nineteenthcentury houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories he seemed to see a vision of london vast and ruinous city of a million dustbins and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons a woman with lined face and wispy hair fiddling helplessly with a blocked wastepipe  he reached down and scratched his ankle again day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food more clothes better houses better recreationsthat they lived longer worked shorter hours were bigger healthier stronger happier more intelligent better educated than the people of fifty years ago not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved the party claimed for example that today  per cent of adult proles were literate before the revolution it was said the number had only been  per cent the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only  per thousand whereas before the revolution it had been and so it went on it was like a single equation with two unknowns it might very well be that literally every word in the history books even the things that one accepted without question was pure fantasy for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis or any such creature as a capitalist or any such garment as a top hat  everything faded into mist the past was erased the erasure was forgotten the lie became truth just once in his life he had possessedafter the event that was what countedconcrete unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds in  it must have beenat any rate it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier  the story really began in the middle sixties the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all by  none of them was left except big brother himself all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counterrevolutionaries goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where and of the others a few had simply disappeared while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes among the last survivors were three men named jones aaronson and rutherford it must have been in  that these three had been arrested as often happened they had vanished for a year or more so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy at that date too the enemy was eurasia embezzlement of public funds the murder of various trusted party members intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people after confessing to these things they had been pardoned reinstated in the party and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important all three had written long abject articles in the times analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends  some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye they were men far older than himself relics of the ancient world almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them he had the feeling though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother but also they were outlaws enemies untouchables doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave  there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe of the three it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution even now at long intervals his cartoons were appearing in the times they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner and curiously lifeless and unconvincing always they were a rehashing of the ancient themesslum tenements starving children street battles capitalists in top hatseven on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless hopeless effort to get back into the past he was a monstrous man with a mane of greasy grey hair his face pouched and seamed with thick negroid lips at one time he must have been immensely strong now his great body was sagging sloping bulging falling away in every direction he seemed to be breaking up before ones eyes like a mountain crumbling  it was the lonely hour of fifteen winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time the place was almost empty a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens the three men sat in their corner almost motionless never speaking uncommanded the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin there was a chessboard on the table beside them with the pieces set out but no game started and then for perhaps half a minute in all something happened to the telescreens the tune that they were playing changed and the tone of the music changed too there came into itbut it was something hard to describe it was a peculiar cracked braying jeering note in his mind winston called it a yellow note and then a voice from the telescreen was singing     under the spreading chestnut tree   i sold you and you sold me   there lie they and here lie we   under the spreading chestnut tree   the three men never stirred but when winston glanced again at rutherfords ruinous face he saw that his eyes were full of tears and for the first time he noticed with a kind of inward shudder and yet not knowing at what he shuddered t\n"
